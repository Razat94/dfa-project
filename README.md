# <p align="center"> "Are the rich becoming richer, while the poor become poorer?" </p>

## What is this?
This is a simple Python Notebook that will attempt to shed light on the validity of the phase:
"The rich have become richer, and the poor have become poorer"

## Where did the data come from?
I got the data from [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/). <br />
Additionally, I have the csv file located in the same directory. You can see it [here](practice-dfa.csv)

## Where can I see the notebook?
You should be able to see it [here](dfa-project.ipynb)

## What have you learned from analyzing the data?
I have not come to any conclusions yet simply because I am still analyzing the data.

## Are you done with this notebook?
IN PROGRESS.
